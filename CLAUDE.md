# HWR Moodle Scraper — CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview
A CLI-based web scraper that pulls all content from HWR Berlin's Moodle LMS into a structured local folder. First run pulls everything; subsequent runs are incremental (only changed/new content).

## Development Workflow
Follow the phases in `docs/WORKFLOW.md` strictly:
1. Requirements (docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) — must be gap-free before moving on
2. Feature Timeline (docs/FEATURE_TIMELINE.md) — every requirement must be traceable
3. Tests first (tests/ directory) — write tests before implementing features
4. Implementation
5. Iterative feedback incorporation

### Phase 5 Pass Workflow (for new features / improvements)
Each improvement is one "pass" (e.g. Pass 36). The workflow within a pass:

1. **Plan** — use `EnterPlanMode` to explore relevant files and write a plan. Each feature in the pass is its own commit. Surface design decisions (approaches, trade-offs) to the user via `AskUserQuestion` before locking in.
2. **One feature at a time** — implement features sequentially, not in parallel. Each feature follows: tests → implementation → `npx vitest run` → `node scripts/file-checker.js` → commit.
3. **Tests before code** — write failing tests first. Tests live in `tests/unit/` or `tests/integration/`. The test must reference what it covers in a comment.
4. **Commit per feature** — commit message format: `feat(<scope>): <what and why>` or `fix(<scope>): <what and why>`. Include the number of new tests in the body when significant.
5. **End of pass** — bump `package.json` version if user-facing features were added (see versioning below), update `CLAUDE.md` (test count, pass count), rebuild and reinstall: `npm run build && npm install -g .`

### Versioning
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` — for a pre-1.0 project, treat `0.MINOR.PATCH`:
- **MINOR bump** (`0.x.0`) — one or more user-facing features added (new commands, new flags, redesigned UX, new config keys visible to users). Bump when a pass adds features a user would notice.
- **PATCH bump** (`0.0.x`) — bug fixes, internal refactors, test additions, documentation only. No new user-visible behaviour.
- **Never bump for**: doc-only changes, test-only changes, file-checker fixes, CLAUDE.md updates.
- After bumping: rebuild and reinstall with `npm run build && npm install -g .` so the running binary reflects the new version.

## Mottos (priority order)
1. **Security first** — credentials never in logs, no hardcoded secrets, HTTPS only, secure credential storage
2. **Clean code second** — readable, minimal, well-structured
3. **Usability third** — intuitive CLI UX

## Key Rules
- **Never commit credentials or secrets**
- **Always read source before modifying** — never modify a file you have not fully read
- **Tests before features** — write or update the test first; the test must fail before the implementation exists
- **After changes**: run `npx vitest run` — all 734 tests must pass; commit with a contextual message
- **Run file-checker before ending any session**: `node scripts/file-checker.js` must exit 0

## Critical Parsing Patterns — Do Not Regress

These patterns were hard-won through real HTML debugging. Do not simplify or replace them.

### Balanced-div depth counter
Used in three places: `parseActivityFromElement` (activity-altcontent), `extractCourseDescription`, `parseContentTree` (summarytext). A non-greedy regex `[\s\S]*?` stops at the first `</div>` — truncating nested content. The depth counter walks every `<div` (+1) and `</div` (-1) to find the matching closing tag. **Never replace with a regex.**

### extractPageContent (forum.ts)
Called before every Turndown HTML→MD conversion for page-md and forum thread pages. Without it, Turndown converts the full 200 KB Moodle page (nav, scripts, sidebars) into noise. Tries `<div role="main">`, `<div id="page-content">`, `<div id="region-main">` in order. **Never pass raw page HTML to Turndown.**

### Section summaries (_Abschnittsbeschreibung.md) and course README.md
`Section.summary` is populated from `<div class="summarytext">` in `parseContentTree`. Written to `_Abschnittsbeschreibung.md` in the section dir by `runScrape`. Course README.md files come from `ContentTree.summary`. Both are refreshed on every run from live Moodle HTML and are tracked in `State.generatedFiles` (not as FileState entries). `msc status` and `msc reset` read `generatedFiles` to treat them as scraper-owned. Do not add them to the per-resource download plan.

### State registration rule — CRITICAL
**Any file written to disk by `runScrape` that is not stored as a `FileState` entry MUST be added to `State.generatedFiles`.** If it isn't, `msc status` will show it as a user-added file, and `msc reset` will not delete it. The `generatedFiles` list is a flat `string[]` at the top level of `State` (not inside courses/sections). It is merged across runs so partial `--courses` runs don't lose entries from previous runs.

### isSidecar flag (description-md strategy)
`description-md` items generate `.description.md` sidecar files alongside the main activity file. They are tagged `isSidecar: true` in `specialItems` and tracked via `FileState.sidecarPath`. They are excluded from `downloadedCount`, `totalItems` counter, and the progress bar total, but shown separately in the "Done:" summary line. Do not merge them into `downloadedCount`.

### extractCourseDescription candidates
Three CSS class variants are tried in order: `\bsummary\b`, `course-summary-section`, `summarytext`. Note: `\bsummary\b` does NOT match `summarytext` (word boundary fails). All three are needed — different Moodle theme variants use different class names.

### data-activityname (primary name source)
`parseActivityFromElement` uses `data-activityname` as the **primary** activity name source, falling back to link text only if absent. This prevents cross-reference links inside `<li>` elements (e.g. customcert linking to its paired scorm) from polluting activity names. Do not change the priority order.

### Onetopic sectionId mapping
When merging onetopic tab sections into the main content tree, each tab's `sectionNum` is used directly: `sectionId: s${sectionNum}`. **Do not subtract 1** — the old formula `s${sectionNum - 1}` caused collisions when tab 0 exists (e.g. Betriebssystempraxis: tab 0 → "s0" collided with mainTree's section 0). The rename-to-"Allgemeines" heuristic checks `allSections[0]` after sorting by sectionId.

### extractEmbeddedVideoUrls — Pattern 5 (data-embed-frame)
HWR Moodle's `filter_youtube_sanitizer` plugin hides YouTube iframes inside a `data-embed-frame` attribute as HTML-entity-encoded markup (`&lt;iframe...src=&quot;URL&quot;...&gt;`). Pattern 5 in `extractEmbeddedVideoUrls` decodes entities then extracts the `src`. The `youtube-nocookie.com` domain (YouTube privacy-enhanced mode) is matched alongside `youtube.com` and `youtu.be` via the shared `DOMAINS` constant. **Do not remove Pattern 5 or the nocookie domain.**

### isDividerLabel heuristic (label subfolder grouping)
`isDividerLabel(html)` in `dispatch.ts` detects labels that serve as visual section dividers. Two detection paths:

1. **Icon-heading pattern**: `extractIconHeadingText(html)` finds `<img>` + `<h3>`/`<h4>`/`<h5>` structure. Combined with `hasSmallIcon(html)` (width/height ≤ 100px), this identifies decorative icon + heading labels as dividers regardless of subsequent content (attribution links, learning objectives, etc.). `applyLabelSubfolders()` uses the extracted heading text for clean subfolder names instead of the `data-activityname` (which may be polluted with icon credit text).

2. **Text heuristic**: After Turndown conversion: strips image markdown, then checks ≤2 lines, ≤80 chars, no external links, no list items, ≥3 alpha chars.

`applyLabelSubfolders()` walks activities in order — each divider label starts a new subfolder; activities before the first divider stay at section root. Requires ≥2 dividers to activate (safety). **Heuristic tuned against all 42 courses — changing thresholds risks false positives.**

### Content-rich divider labels (_SubfolderName.md)
`isDividerContentRich(html)` in `dispatch.ts` checks if a divider label has substantial content beyond the heading, icon, and attribution text. It strips `<h3>`–`<h5>` headings, `<img>` tags, and "Icons erstellt von" credit paragraphs, then checks if ≥10 alpha chars remain. Content-rich dividers (e.g. "Lernziele" with learning objectives, "Einführung" with course intro) are written as `_SubfolderName.md` inside their subfolder (consistent with `_Ordnerbeschreibung.md` and `_Abschnittsbeschreibung.md`). Heading-only dividers are skipped. **Do not change the ≥10 threshold** — it distinguishes real content from residual attribution text.

### Course name construction (shortname + fullname)
`fetchEnrolledCourses` sets `courseName = shortname !== fullname ? \`${shortname} ${fullname}\` : fullname`. The shortname contains the WI#### module code needed by `parseCourseNameParts` for semester mapping. If shortname === fullname (e.g. "Bibliothek benutzen"), only one copy is used to prevent doubled folder names.

## Agent Usage
| Task | Agent |
|------|-------|
| Elicit / refine requirements | `agents/requirements-engineer.md` |
| Check requirements completeness | `agents/requirements-checker.md` |
| Create feature timeline | `agents/planner.md` |
| Write tests | `agents/test-writer.md` |
| Write implementation code | `agents/developer.md` |
| Update docs before commit | `agents/doc-updater.md` |
| Analyze HTML parsing issues | `agents/html-analyzer.md` |
| Debug scraping errors / file anomalies | `agents/debug-workflow.md` |

## Debug Workflow
When a user reports broken files or before ending a session:
1. Follow `agents/debug-workflow.md` — capture HTML in `debug/` (gitignored), locate bug, write test, fix, re-scrape
2. Run `node scripts/file-checker.js` — must exit 0 before session ends (also runs automatically via Stop hook)
3. Run `msc status --issues` — must show **0 user-added files** that were created by the scraper (i.e. no orphaned state entries). Any file tracked in state that appears as "user-added" signals a path-mismatch bug.
4. Clean `debug/` after file-checker passes

## Current Phase
**Phase 5 — Iterative Improvements (ongoing)**
- All 22 timeline steps fully implemented; 784/784 tests passing (48 test files)
- Full CLI: auth, scrape, status, wizard, reset, tui + first-run wizard + clean
- 43 cleanup/improvement passes completed; current version: `0.6.0`
